Workaround for VMware guest OS Audio Distortion

[Example of audio distortion](https://github.com/Raymai97/VMAudioBack/blob/trunk/vmware-win2k-distort.opus) [Someone also demonstrated this on YouTube](https://youtu.be/4D8BRKvTp7E)

To get started, just download to your Windows guest OS and run VMAudioBack.exe.  
You can add it to run at startup using any creative method.
